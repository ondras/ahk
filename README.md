# AHK scripts

Collection of [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) scripts that I use.

  - [Virtual Desktops](https://github.com/ondras/ahk/blob/master/VirtualDesktops.ahk) - switch Windows 10 desktops with alt+{1..4}, also configurable via tray menu
  - [WM](https://github.com/ondras/ahk/blob/master/WM.ahk) - linux-like window dragging/resizing with alt+mouse
  - [Screensaver](https://github.com/ondras/ahk/blob/master/Screensaver.ahk) - hit ctrl+shift+s to blank the screen
  - [Tablet](https://github.com/ondras/ahk/blob/master/Tablet.ahk) - screensaver and key remapping for the Chuwi Ubook 2-in-1 device
